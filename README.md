This project is a number-matching game.

RULES:
At the start of each new round:
1. A target number between 19 and 120 is randomly generated and displayed. 
2. The four gems are assigned new random numbers between 1 and 12.
The object of the game is to arrive at the target number by clicking on the gems.
When the player clicks on a gem, its hidden number is added to the playerâ€™s total.
If the player goes over the target number, the player loses.
If the player hits the target number, the player wins.
The display tallies wins and losses over consecutive rounds.
 
The project is an exercise in learning JavaScript. It is designed to give new web designers practice making responsive web pages.
